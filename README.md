# portscan-rs

portscan-rs is a part of a larger project of tools for multithreaded surface attack discovery and other basic black hat tools implemented in rust with guidance from Black-Hat Rust 

The Version 1.0 is highly unoptimised and uses only a single source for domain scanning

#TODO:


Add more sources
Make Scanning Faster
Reduce size of binary(offset most common ports being built into the file)
increase the domain of port searching
